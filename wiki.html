	<h1><center>Railroad IDE Wiki</center></h1>
	<p><center>Welcome to the Railroad IDE Wiki page. Here you can learn about installing and</center></p><br><p><center>using Railroad IDE, as well as creating plugins for the software.</center></p>
	
	<h2><center>0.0 - Installation</center></h2>
	<p>You can install the IDE by selecting the right download from <a href="download.html">this page</a>. Once that installer downloads, open it, and you will be guided through the installation process.</p>
	
	<h2><center>1.0 - Usage</center></h2>
	<p>This chapter will teach you how to use Railroad IDE. You can start by creating a project...</p>
	
	<h2><center>1.1 - Setting up a Mod</center></h2>
	<h2><center>1.2 - Running the Mod</center></h2>
	<h2><center>1.3 - Texture Editor</center></h2>
	<h2><center>1.4 - Model Editor</center></h2>
	
	<h2><center>2.0 - Plugins</center></h2>
	<p>This chapter will teach you how to create plugins for Railroad with a few simple json files.</p>
	
	<h2><center>2.1 - Custom Themes</center></h2>
	
	<h2><center>2.2 - Custom Syntax Highlighting</center></h2>
	<p>You will need to start by creating a file under <code>assets/syntax/</code> called something like <code>language-syntax.json</code>. This JSON file will define what regex syntax corresponds to what colour.</p><br>
	<p><i>NOTE: JVM Languages need a Java Plugin to function correctly, but some basic syntax highlighting can still be done.</i></p>
	<p>Inside the JSON file, we need to define a few things. First, we need to tell the program what file extension to associate this json with. To do that, we give the key <code>"extension"</code> the value of the extension, so in the case of java files, this would be <code>"extension": "java"</p><br>
	<p>Next, we need to define the path for the css. To do that, we add <code>"css_path": "styles/syntax/mylanguage"<code>. For example, for java, this would be <code>"css_path": "styles/syntax/java"<code>.</p><br>
	<p>Finally, we can add the rules. To do that, create an array under the rules key: <code>"rules": []</code>, inside of which we can add our rules. To add a rule, we can open curly brackets, inside of which we need to define two values: <code>regex</code> and <code>type</code>.</p><br>
	<p>In the regex key, we need to put the regular expression that matches the sytnax rule. Make sure to escape any backslashes with a second backslash. (e.g. <code>"\"</code> becomes <code>"\\"</code>. For the type key, put the css class that corresponds to that regex. (e.g. <code>keyword</code>).</p><br>
	<p>We can add as many of these rules as we want, the syntax json for JSON files can be seen below:</p><br>
